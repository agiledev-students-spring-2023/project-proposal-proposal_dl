# Driply

### What and why?

I'm always looking out for new fashion and styles to experiment with, but often find the most popular options seen on influencers and social networks are out of my price ranges. Therefore, I want to create a social networking app entirely dedicated to budget fashion, where users can share their outfits and find inspirations as well as possible new stores from others.

While most social networks with a photo-posting function can do this, I want to build a community dedicated to making fashion and trends as accessible as possible for everyone, especially students and others who might not have the budget for designer brands. 

### For whom?

The primary target user demographic is high school and college students, who are often interested in improving their fashion style but do not have the necessary funds for it. 

### How?

The app will:
- Allow users to post photos of their outfits
- Allow users to add a price tag and a store to each piece of their outfit so others can check it out
- Allow users to like and comment on each other's posts
- Allow users to create their own profiles and message each other

### Scope

Considering the need for UX/UI, frontend, backend, basic security features and a reliable database, Driply is definitely not easy for 4-6 developers, but since the application can be built based on other social networking apps, it won't be too complicated either.
